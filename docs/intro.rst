Introduction
============

ifuanal is a python package aimed at automating the stellar continuum and
emission line fitting of resolved galaxies.

The code can bin spaxels which are sent forward for Stellar continuum fitting
with the `STARLIGHT <http://astro.ufsc.br/starlight/>`_ spectral synthesis tool
and emission lines fitting fit as a series of single gaussians.

Results from these analysis can be accessed via a number of built-in analysis
tools (e.g. producing kinematics or metallicity maps).
