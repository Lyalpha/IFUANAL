Introduction
============

ifuanal is a python package aimed at automating the stellar continuum and
emission line fitting of resolved galaxies IFU observations. The code has been
developed with MUSE data of nearby transient host galaxies in mind.

The code can bin spaxels which are sent forward for stellar continuum fitting,
with the `STARLIGHT <http://astro.ufsc.br/starlight/>`_ spectral synthesis tool,
and emission line fitting.

Results from these analysis can be accessed via a number of built-in analysis
tools (e.g. producing kinematics or metallicity maps).
