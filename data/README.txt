To make additions, follow the format of the default lines. 

Note even single lines should be in the form of a list.

The entries for "Halpha" and "[NII]" are required by ifuanal and 
should not be altered.

Balmer lines are tied in offset and stddev to Halpha[0], and 
forbidden are tied to [NII][1].

Forbidden lines are taken as any following the "[name]" convention. 

*No underscores in the names!*
