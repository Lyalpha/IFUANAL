#TODOs

#TODO    : Allow FWHM to vary between emission lines and keep only tied
#          per entry (i.e. both [NII] are tied, but these are not tied
#          to [OIII]

#TODO    : rewrite binning methods to workers that return an array of just
#          {"mean":.., "spax":...} then populate spectra/distances by
#          master bin method.

#TODO    : make_emission_line_cube/make_continuum_cube to just
#          make_results_cube also containign bin segmap and BINTable of results

#TODO    : add a binning method that uses image segmentation via photutils
#          and is similar to SExtractor

#TODO    : bin_inspection - i.e.: make a plot of all indiv specs in bin and the
#          weighted spec, show location on voronoi plot, print results of
#          fitting, overplot fit on weighted spec etc.

#TODO    : make all bin numbers, the x/y coordinates, the weighted spec, the
#          starlight outputs the error spec, the s/n of the bin etc. all in a
#          big astropy table. Then can parse this easily for output analysis

#TODO    : put all output into a subdir of the basedir instead

#TODO    : output plots with RA/DEC instead of just pixels?

#TODO    : only calculate metallicities when its within bound of validity for
#          the indicator (otherwise nan), and also propogate errors onto the
#          value (excluding intrinsic scatter about the relations themselves).

#TODO:     create data/metallicity_indicators.json for custom indicators to be
#          used/added

#TODO:     allow a low order polynomial/spline or linear continuum to be sub-
#          tracted from the spectra after stellar continuum fitting and prior
#          to emission line fitting?
